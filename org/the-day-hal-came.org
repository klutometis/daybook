I wish we could have recorded the session; off the top of my head,
though, we touched on a few talking points:

- “Amb” was a McCarthyesque back-tracking apparatus that they stuck
  “in the guts of the language.”
- They had considered first-class irrationals like pi; the question
  is, what do you compute on such things?
- Linguistic programming is key; the idea where you think primarily
  about what sort of language you want to think in, then implement it.
- Should they have done more with the object-oriented stuff in chapter
  3?
- SICP is about peeling away successive layers of magic, until you
  have a full mental model for how (+ 2 2) computes 4.
- There is a lot you can do with functional decomposition.
- Math was a way to “sell” SICP to MIT-frosh; nowadays, calculus seems
  to scare people away.
