#+TITLE: The book of inflaton (sic)
#+DATE: <2015-02-05>

Whoever owns the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflaton][inflaton field]] whence our visible patch of universe
sprang was nice enough to install [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle][Heisenberg uncertainty]], so that the
experiment doesn’t run deterministically—a little stochastic wasabi
with our universal roll.

Or, as [[http://mattcrain.com/][Matt Crain]] said, Heisenberg uncertainty is an artifact of
floating-point imprecision; exactly! The Book of Inflaton should
contain a Gospel of Floating Point.

“[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_is_theft!][Property is theft]],” because we’re residing upon and working a parcel
within our inflaton-lord’s manor; which lord, in turn, answers to the
singularity’s crown.

Who is the singularity’s crown? Physics asymptotically approaches the
answer, but only as far as the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_epoch][Planck epoch]].
