Non-deterministic navigation

[[http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/][AIMA]] 4.12 modifies the [[./online-depth-first-search.html][partially observable navigation world]], adding
some non-determinism: when the robot moves to point $P$ to $Q$, $30\%$
of the time it will end up at $Q'$: where $Q'$ is $P$ (it did not move
at all) or some random $R \in N(P)$ (a random neighbor of $P$).

An upshot of this non-determinism is that our transition model is no
longer straightforward; for instance, the following deterministic
graph:

#+ATTR_HTML: class="natural"
#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file ../static/deterministic-graph.png
  digraph G {
    graph [rankdir=LR]
    A -> B [label="α"]
    B -> A [label="-α"]
    A -> C [label="β"]
    C -> A [label="-β"]
    C -> D [label="γ"]
    D -> C [label="-γ"]
  }
#+END_SRC

has this transition model:

|-------+---+--------+-------+--------|
| State |   | Action |       | Result |
|-------+---+--------+-------+--------|
| <c>   |   | <c>    |       | <c>    |
| A     | + | α      | $\to$ | B      |
| B     | + | -α     | $\to$ | A      |
| A     | + | β      | $\to$ | C      |
| C     | + | -β     | $\to$ | A      |
| C     | + | γ      | $\to$ | D      |
| D     | + | -γ     | $\to$ | C      |
|-------+---+--------+-------+--------|

Whereas, with a non-deterministic graph, we might see something like
this (with less probable transitions dashed):

#+ATTR_HTML: class="natural"
#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file ../static/non-deterministic-graph.png
  digraph G {
    graph [rankdir=LR]
    A -> B [label="α"]
    A -> B [label="β", style=dashed]
    A -> A [label="α", style=dashed]
    A -> A [label="β", style=dashed]
    B -> A [label="-α"]
    A -> C [label="β"]
    C -> A [label="-β"]
    C -> A [label="γ", style=dashed]
    C -> C [label="γ", style=dashed]
    C -> D [label="γ"]
    C -> D [label="-β", style=dashed]
    D -> C [label="-γ"]
  }
#+END_SRC

and a probabilistic transition model:

|-------+---+--------+-------+--------+--------|
| State |   | Action |       | Result |      P |
|-------+---+--------+-------+--------+--------|
| <c>   |   | <c>    |       | <c>    |    <r> |
| A     | + | α      | $\to$ | B      | $0.63$ |
| A     | + | α      | $\to$ | A      | $0.37$ |
| A     | + | β      | $\to$ | B      | $0.10$ |
| A     | + | β      | $\to$ | A      | $0.05$ |
| A     | + | β      | $\to$ | C      | $0.85$ |
| B     | + | -α     | $\to$ | A      |  $1.0$ |
| C     | + | -β     | $\to$ | A      | $0.71$ |
| C     | + | -β     | $\to$ | D      | $0.29$ |
| C     | + | γ      | $\to$ | A      | $0.20$ |
| C     | + | γ      | $\to$ | C      | $0.13$ |
| C     | + | γ      | $\to$ | D      | $0.67$ |
| D     | + | -γ     | $\to$ | C      |  $1.0$ |
|-------+---+--------+-------+--------+--------|

If we perform $α$ at $A$ and expect to be at $B$ but wind up instead
at $C$, we can (in the presence of data) determine that a statistical
anomaly took place and try to correct it.

Compound error, &c.
