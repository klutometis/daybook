Extending “once, twice, thrice”

Oxford [[http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-comes-after-once-twice-thrice][claims]] that “there is nothing after once, twice, thrice:” fuck
that.

It turns out that “once,” “twice” and the like are based on the
composition of an ancient numerical adverb with the adverbial genitive
suffix /-s/ (see [[adverbs][table 1]]).

With a little philological /Schadenfreude/, we can continue this
series (see [[new-adverbs][table 2]]).

Coming up with novel compounds is the ancient pastime of dabbling
philologasters;[fn:1] more difficult is selling them to an
intransigent public.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] “Philologaster” (a pseudo-philologist) comes from
/philologue/ + /-aster/: a suffix expressing incomplete resemblance.
