#+TITLE: The language of composers
#+DATE: <2015-03-05>

It’s interesting to me that one seems to acquire techinacl facilities
“for free” by learning the language of a composer; when I started the
Well-Tempered Clavier, for instance, some of the fugues were beyond me
but seemed to become more tractable as time went by.

In that sense, I think there’s an argument for starting from the first
e.g. nocturne and working through; similarly, the Beethoven sonatas
seem to have a linear progression: tricks learned from previous
sonatas are applicable to subsequent ones.

Maybe that’s why people (myself included) have such a hard time
jumping straight into subsequent movements of the Moonlight, /et
similia/: there are entire libraries missing from their project file,
so to speak.
