Artist

The artist looks at nature; imprints the same on his neurons; and
turns to the canvas to exhaust his impression.[fn:1]

The heroic algorithmist did the same with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing][metallurgy]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm][genetics]] and
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network][neurology]].

This is, more generally, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_computing][natural computation]].

* Footnotes

[fn:1] See the Greek apo..., a word Plato used for drawing, which
  expresses the same thing.
