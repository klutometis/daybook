Around 2:00 am, I heard a violent rustling of feathers and stepped
outside to see what was the matter; seeing nothing but a spooked
rooster, I stepped back inside.

That quietude I experienced was, it turns out, mortal: a bobcat had
massacred my chickens for sport, leaving the cock intact. I discovered
this when there appeared the apparition of a levitating chicken on the
lawn which, upon closer inspection, was suspended in the maw of its
ailuroid plunderer.

Deliberating between my sword and shotgun; I equipped myself with
Andúril, sword of Aragorn, and advanced on the beast: who nevertheless
scaled the seven foot wall, chicken in mouth.

The unwived cock, in the meantime, had taken to consorting with dogs;
but eventually leapt the wall himself in pursuit of the neighbor’s
hens, only to be rebuffed by his gallinaceous rival.

The sole cock, bloodied and henless, is not himself.

** Update

We’ve since provided him with a micro-harem, and he’s taken to
shepardship with gusto; propagating his hens from plum-trees to grass
to corn with a paternal rigour.
