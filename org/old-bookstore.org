Old bookstore

I wish I could preserve the smell of the old bookstore (see [[cliffs][figure

This is my last chance to browse in a joint that doesn’t ply my
confirmation bias with its hideous machine learning. The bookstore is
a random walk with simulated annealing, having honed in on interesting
sections. It’s a good way to shake oneself out of local maxima in a
way that, say, Amazon can’t quite.

Local maxima can be social: “this is what people are reading;”
relational: “people who read $x$ also read $y$.” What’s missing,
however, is the long tail; the forest of parentless roots discoverable
by the random walk.[fn:1]

Old bookstores are optimized for the random walk (peregrination); and
the random walk is missing from the bubbles of confirmation bias which
shield us from the stochastic, the chaotic.

The internet has become so fucking safe.

  propagate it to machine.
