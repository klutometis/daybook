#+TITLE: Cleromancy or promote randomly!
#+DATE: <2015-03-12>

Have you heard of [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.0455v3.pdf][this study]], by the way, where Pluchino, et al. found
that promoting people randomly is optimal?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Within a game theory-like approach, we explore different promotion
strategies and we find, counterintuitively, that . . . the best ways
for improving the efficiency of a given organization are either to
promote each time an agent at random or to promote randomly the best
and the worst members in terms of competence.
#+END_QUOTE

This assumes that the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Principle][Peter Principle]] holds.

I wonder what Google looks like in a parallel universe in which promo
committees have been replaced by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleromancy][cleromancy]]?
